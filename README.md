# Diabetes_Prediction_With_ML

# Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the Pima Indians Diabetes Database, which can be found at Kaggle. The dataset contains several medical predictor variables and one target variable (Outcome).

# Features:
Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant
Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
Blood Pressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
Skin Thickness: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
Diabetes Pedigree Function: A function that scores the likelihood of diabetes based on family history
Age: Age (years)
Outcome: Class variable (0 or 1), where 1 indicates diabetes


# Model
This project implements the Random Forest Classifier, which is an ensemble learning method that constructs multiple decision trees during training and outputs the class that is the mode of the classes (classification) of the individual trees.

# Advantages of Random Forest:

Handles large datasets with higher dimensionality.
Provides feature importance, helping in understanding which features are most influential in making predictions.
Reduces the risk of overfitting compared to a single decision tree.
